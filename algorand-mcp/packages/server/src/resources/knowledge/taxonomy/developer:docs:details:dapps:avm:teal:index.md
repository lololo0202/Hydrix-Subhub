title: The smart contract language

Smart contracts and smart signatures are written in Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL). These contracts can be written directly or with Python using the [PyTeal library](/docs/get-details/dapps/writing-contracts/pyteal).

TEAL is an assembly-like language and is processed by the Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM). The language is a Turing-complete language that supports looping and subroutines, but limits the amount of time the contract has to execute using a dynamic opcode cost evaluation algorithm.  TEAL programs are processed one line at a time pushing and popping values on and off the stack. These stack values are either unsigned 64 bit integers or byte strings. TEAL provides a set of operators that operate on the values within the stack. TEAL also allows arguments to be passed into the program from a transaction, a scratch space to temporarily store values for use later in the program, access to grouped or single transaction properties, global values, a couple of pseudo operators, constants and flow control functions like `bnz` for branching and `callsub` for calling subroutines. Smart contracts can read and write global storage for the contract and local storage for accounts that opt-in to the contract. Smart contracts also have the ability to generate both asset and payment transactions within the logic. Using this ability, they can function as escrow accounts. See [TEAL Specification Reference](specification) for more details.

Some of the opcodes in TEAL are only valid for a specific contract type. These are denoted in the [TEAL Opcodes](opcodes) documentation with a `Mode` attribute. This attribute will be set to `Signature` for smart signatures and `Application` for smart contracts. For example, reading account assets or Algo balances is only available in smart contracts.

!!! warning
    When writing smart contracts, make sure to follow [TEAL guidelines](guidelines). This is very important in order to prevent smart contracts from being compromised.

# Program versions
Currently, Algorand supports versions 1 through 8 of TEAL. When writing contracts with program version 2 or higher, make sure to add `#pragma version #` where # should be replaced by the specific number, as the first line of the program. If this line does not exist, the protocol will treat the contract as a version 1 contract. If upgrading a contract to version 2 or higher, it is important to verify you are checking the `RekeyTo` property of all transactions that are attached to the contract. See the [TEAL guidelines](guidelines) for more suggestions to help prevent a contract from being compromised. 

# Getting transaction properties
The primary purpose of a TEAL program is to return either true or false. When the program completes, if there is a non-zero value on the stack then it returns true. If there is a zero value or the stack is empty, it will return false. If the stack has more than one value the program also returns false unless the `return` opcode is used. The following diagram illustrates how the stack machine processes the program.

Program line number 1:

<center>*Getting Transaction Properties*</center>

The program uses the `txn` to reference the current transaction's list of properties. Grouped transaction properties are referenced using `gtxn` and `gtxns`. The number of transactions in a grouped transaction is available in the global variable `GroupSize`. To get the first transaction's receiver use `gtxn 0 Receiver`. See [TEAL Specification Reference](specification) for more transaction properties.

# Pseudo opcodes
The TEAL specification provides several pseudo opcodes for convenience.  For example, the second line in the program below uses the `addr` pseudo opcode.

<center>![Pseudo Opcodes](../../../../imgs/teal_overview-3.png)</center>
<center>*Pseudo Opcodes*</center>

The `addr` pseudo opcode converts Algorand addresses to a byte constant and pushes the result to the stack. See [TEAL Specification Reference](specification) for additional pseudo opcodes.

# Operators
TEAL provides operators to work with data that is on the stack. For example, the `==` operator evaluates if the last two values on the stack are equal and pushes either a 1 or 0 depending on the result. The number of values used by an operator will depend on the operator. The [TEAL Opcodes](opcodes) documentation explains arguments and return values. See [TEAL Specification Reference](specification) for a list of all operators.

# Argument passing
TEAL supports program arguments. Smart contracts and smart signatures handle these parameters with different opcodes. For information on passing parameters to smart contracts, see the smart contract [Overview](../../smart-contracts/apps/index.md) documentation. Passing parameters to a smart signature is explained in the [Interact with smart signatures](../../smart-contracts/frontend/smartsigs.md) documentation. The [CLI smart signatures](../../smart-contracts/smartsigs/walkthrough.md) documentation explains a simple example of passing a parameter to a smart signature with the `goal` command-line tool. 

The diagram below shows an example of logic that is loading a parameter onto the stack within a smart signature. 

<center>![Arguments](../../../../imgs/teal_overview-5.png)</center>
<center>*Arguments*</center>

All argument parameters to a TEAL program are byte arrays. The order that parameters are passed is specific. In the diagram above, The first parameter is pushed onto the stack. The SDKs provide standard language functions that allow you to convert parameters to a byte array. 

# Storing and loading from scratchspace
TEAL provides a scratch space as a way of temporarily storing values for use later in your code. The diagram below illustrates a small TEAL program that loads 12 onto the stack and then duplicates it. These values are multiplied together and result (144) is pushed to the top of the stack. The store command stores the value in the scratch space 1 slot.

<center>![Storing Values](../../../../imgs/teal_overview-6.png)</center>
<center>*Storing Values*</center>

The load command is used to retrieve a value from the scratch space as illustrated in the diagram below. Note that this operation does not clear the scratch space slot, which allows a stored value to be loaded many times if necessary.

# Looping and subroutines
TEAL contracts written in version 4 or higher can use loops and subroutines. Loops can be performed using any of the branching opcodes `b`, `bz`, and `bnz`. For example the TEAL below loops ten times.

```teal
#pragma version 4
// loop 1 - 10
// init loop var
int 0 
loop:
int 1
+
dup
// implement loop code
// ...
// check upper bound
int 10
<=
bnz loop
// once the loop exits, the last counter value will be left on stack
```

Subroutines can be implemented using labels and the `callsub` and `retsub` opcodes. The sample below illustrates a sample subroutine call.

```teal
#pragma version 4
// jump to main loop
b main

// subroutine
my_subroutine:
// implement subroutine code
// with the two args
retsub

main:
int 1
int 5
callsub my_subroutine
return
```

# Dynamic operational cost of TEAL opcodes
Smart signature are limited to 1000 bytes in size. Size encompasses the compiled program plus arguments. Smart contracts are limited to 2KB total for the compiled approval and clear programs. This size can be increased in 2KB increments, up to an 8KB limit for both programs. 

For optimal performance, smart contracts and smart signatures are also limited in opcode cost. This cost is evaluated when a smart contract runs and is representative of itâ€™s computational expense. Every opcode executed by the AVM has a numeric value that represents its computational cost. Most opcodes have a computational cost of 1. Some, such as `SHA256` (cost 35) or `ed25519verify` (cost 1900) have substantially larger computational costs. The [TEAL Opcodes](opcodes) reference lists the opcode cost for every opcode.

Smart signatures are limited to 20,000 for total computational cost. 

Smart contracts invoked by a single application transaction are limited to 700 for either of the programs associated with the contract. However, if the smart contract is invoked via a group of application transactions, the computational budget for approval programs is considered pooled. The total opcode budget will be 700 multiplied by the number of application transactions within the group (including inner transactions). So if the maximum transaction group size is used (i.e., 16 transactions) and the maximum number of inner transactions is used (i.e., 256 inner transactions) and all are application transactions, the computational budget would be 700x(16+256)=190,400. 

!!! info
    Executions of clear state programs are more stringent than approval programs, in order to ensure that applications may be closed out, but that applications also are assured a chance to clean up their internal state. At the beginning of the execution of a clear state program, the pooled budget available must be 700 or higher. If it is not, the containing transaction group fails without clearing the app's state. During the execution of the clear state program, no more than 700 cost may be drawn. If further execution is attempted, the clear state program fails, and the app's state is cleared.


# Example walkthrough of a TEAL program
The example covered in this tutorial is for a smart signature contract account TEAL program. The account is set up where all tokens are removed from the account with one successful transaction and delivered to one of two accounts. Unsuccessful transactions leave the funds in the contract account.

The example uses two addresses (addr1 and addr2). The variables have the values of addr1 = `RFGEHKTFSLPIEGZYNVYALM6J4LJX4RPWERDWYS2PFKNVDWW3NG7MECQTJY` and addr2 = `SOEI4UA72A7ZL5P25GNISSVWW724YABSGZ7GHW5ERV4QKK2XSXLXGXPG5Y`.  The variable addr1 represents the creator of the contact account. The addr1 account funds the contract account after creation. The variable addr2 is the intended recipient of the funds, but only if addr2 supplies a proper secret key and the transaction must be submitted within a time limit (represented with a number of blocks). If addr2 does not submit the transaction in time or canâ€™t supply the proper secret key, addr1 can submit the transaction and retrieve all the tokens. The transaction fee for the transaction is limited to no more than 1 Algo and this must not be a rekey transaction. The pseudo-code for this example is represented with the following logic:

``` go
((addr2 and secret) || (addr1 and timeout)) && (ok fee and !rekey)
```

The example uses the `CloseRemainderTo` field to close out the account and move all funds to either addr1 or addr2 on a successful transaction.

The first clause of the pseudo logic is implemented with the following TEAL.

```teal
// Are used to comment in TEAL
// htlc.teal
// Push the CloseRemainderTo property of the current transaction onto the stack
txn CloseRemainderTo

// Push addr2 onto the stack as the intended recipient
addr SOEI4UA72A7ZL5P25GNISSVWW724YABSGZ7GHW5ERV4QKK2XSXLXGXPG5Y

// The == operator is used to verify that both of these are the same
// This pops the two values off the stack and pushes the result 0 or 1
==

// Push the current transactionâ€™s Receiver property onto the stack
// In this example it should be addr2
txn Receiver

// Push addr2 on the stack using the addr constant
addr SOEI4UA72A7ZL5P25GNISSVWW724YABSGZ7GHW5ERV4QKK2XSXLXGXPG5Y

// Use the == to verify that these are equal which pops off the top two values of the stack
// and returns 0 or 1
==

// The stack should currently have two values from the two top conditions
// These will be either 0s or 1s
// Push the && operator which will AND the two previous conditions and return
// either 0 or 1, which leaves one value on the stack either a 0 or a 1
&&

// Push the first argument to the transaction onto the stack
arg 0

// The len operator pops the arg off the stack and 
// pushes the length of the argument onto the stack
len

// Push a constant int of value 46 onto the stack
int 46

// The == operator verifies that the length of the argument
// is equal to 46. This pops the two values and returns a 0 or 1
// The stack now contains two values with a value of 0 or 1
==

// The && operator will AND the two values in the stack
// which pops both values off the stack and returns a 0 or 1
// The stack should now only have one value on the stack, 0 or 1
&&

// arg 0 is pushed back onto the stack
// This represents the hashed passcode
arg 0

// The sha256 operator pops the arg 0 off the stack
// and pushes the hash value of the argument onto the stack
sha256

// The constant byte array of the base64 version of our secret is pushed onto the stack
byte base64 QzYhq9JlYbn2QdOMrhyxVlNtNjeyvyJc/I8d8VAGfGc=

// The == operator pops the two values and pushes 0 or 1 onto the stack
// If arg0 is equal to the secret this value will be 1 and if not it will be 0
==

// Two values are now on the stack. The && operator is used 
// to pop the last two values and push either 0 or 1
// This will AND all previous conditions to this one.
// The stack should only have a 0 or 1 value now
&&

```

The second clause of the pseudo logic is implemented with the following TEAL.

```teal

// The following six lines of teal check if the 
// transaction receiver is set to addr1 and that the CloseRemainderTo
// transaction property is also set to addr1.
// Once completed the stack will have the 0 or 1 
// from the previous clause and a 1 or 0 from the 
// the beginning of the second clause. 
txn CloseRemainderTo
addr RFGEHKTFSLPIEGZYNVYALM6J4LJX4RPWERDWYS2PFKNVDWW3NG7MECQTJY
==
txn Receiver
addr RFGEHKTFSLPIEGZYNVYALM6J4LJX4RPWERDWYS2PFKNVDWW3NG7MECQTJY
==
&&

// The FirstValid parameter from the transaction is pushed onto the stack
txn FirstValid

// The constant int value of 67240 is pushed onto the stack
// This is a hard coded round number and is only used here as an example
int 67240

// The > operator is used to check if First Valid is greater than 67240
// This is used to see if the transaction is timed out and if so addr1 can
// Submit the transaction to return the funds.
// This pops the last two values and returns a 0 or 1
// At the end of this operation, we should have 
// three values on the stack. One for the first clause, and two for the second clause
>

// The && operator is used to AND the last two options in the second clause which pops the
// last two values and pushes a 1 or 0. This will leave only two values on the stack
&&

```

This completes the second clause. Clause 1 and 2 are ORed together.

```teal
// The || operator is pushed onto the stack which ORs
// the first two clauses
// and pops the two values and pushes a 0 or 1 
|| 
```

The third clause is responsible for verifying that the transaction fee is below 1 Algo and that no rekey operation is happening. This is an important check to prevent an account from being cleared by an errant transaction fee requirement or assigned to a new private key.

```teal

// The current transaction fee is pushed onto the stack
txn Fee

// The constant integer of value 1000000 is pushed
// onto the stack, which is specified in micro Algos
// In this example this equates to 1 Algo
int 1000000 

// The < operator is used to pop those last two values and replace with a 
// 0 or 1. This just verifies that the fee is not greater than 1 Algo 
<

// Next the transaction RekeyTo property is pushed onto the stack.
txn RekeyTo

// The global zero address is then pushed onto the stack. 
global ZeroAddress

// the == operator will replace the last two fields with a 0 or a 1. If the value is 1, this is not a rekey transaction.
==

// next the && operator is used to AND the two conditions in the third clause.
// At this point there will be two values on the stack
&&
```

The && is the final operator used in this example. This ANDs the third clause with the result of the OR operation between the first and second clauses.

```teal
// The && operator is used to pop those values by anding them and pushing either 
// a 1 or 0
// Since this is the end of the program this value represents the return value
// and determines if the transaction executed successfully 
&&
```
