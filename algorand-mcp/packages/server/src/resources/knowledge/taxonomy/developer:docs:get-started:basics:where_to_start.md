title: Where do I start?

# Smart contracts & dApps

If you are interested in building an application([dApp](whats_a_dapp.md)) on Algorand, checkout [Algokit](/docs/get-started/algokit), which is a tool for quickly building, testing, and deploying Algorand smart contracts.

# Tokenization

This section will walk you through the basics of tokenizing assets on Algorand. We’ll start with showing you how Alice and Bob tokenize their NFT, and then walk through creating fungible tokens. You don’t need to write smart contract code to tokenize assets on Algorand. Assets are a layer-1 primitive, built right into the protocol itself.
