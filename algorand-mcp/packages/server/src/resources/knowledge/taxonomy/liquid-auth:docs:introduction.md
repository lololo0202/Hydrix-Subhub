Liquid Auth aims to give the user full control over their data and privacy.
There are far too many services that act as a middle man between the end user and the wallet provider.

By combining the security of FIDO2/WebAuthn with the decentralized nature of WebRTC, Liquid Auth provides a secure and private way for users to communicate.


## What is Liquid Auth?

Liquid Auth is a self-hosted authentication service that provides a simple way to associate Passkeys to KeyPair(s) commonly found in cryptocurrencies.

In addition to authentication, Liquid Auth provides a Peer to Peer signaling service.
Not only can you authenticate users, but you can also establish secure connections between them.
