A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides onchain tools for AI applications like Claude Desktop and Cursor, allowing them to interact with the Base Network and Coinbase API.

## Overview

This MCP server extends any MCP client's capabilities by providing tools to do anything on Base:

- Retrieve wallet addresses
- List wallet balances
- Transfer funds between wallets
- Deploy smart contracts
- Interact with Morpho vaults for onchain lending
- Call contract functions
- Onramp funds via [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform/products/onramp)
- Manage ERC20 tokens
- List and transfer NFTs (ERC721 and ERC1155)
- Buy [OpenRouter](http://openrouter.ai/) credits with USDC
- Resolve Farcaster usernames to Ethereum addresses

The server interacts with Base, powered by Base Developer Tools and [AgentKit](https://github.com/coinbase/agentkit).

## Extending Base MCP with 3P Protocols, Tools, and Data Sources

Base MCP is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add your own third-party protocols, tools, and data sources. This section provides an overview of how to extend the Base MCP server with new capabilities.

### Adding New Tools

If you want to add a new tool to the Base MCP server, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory in the `src/tools` directory for your tool
2. Implement the tool following the existing patterns:
   - `index.ts`: Define and export your tools. Tools are defined as AgentKit ActionProviders.
   - `schemas.ts`: Define input schemas for your tools
   - `types.ts`: Define types required for your tools
   - `utils.ts`: Utilities for your tools
3. Add your tool to the list of available tools in `src/main.ts`
4. Add documentation for your tool in the README.md
5. Add examples of how to use your tool in examples.md
6. Write tests for your tool

### Project Structure

The Base MCP server follows this structure for tools:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [TOOL_NAME]/ <-------------------------- ADD DIR HERE
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts (defines and exports tools)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schemas.ts (defines input schema)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/ (shared tool utilities)
```

### Best Practices for Tool Development

When developing new tools for Base MCP:

- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Ensure your tool has a clear, focused purpose
- Provide comprehensive input validation
- Include detailed error handling
- Write thorough documentation
- Add examples demonstrating how to use your tool
- Include tests for your tool

## Security Considerations

- The configuration file contains sensitive information (API keys and seed phrases). Ensure it's properly secured and not shared.
- Consider using environment variables or a secure credential manager instead of hardcoding sensitive information.
- Be cautious when transferring funds or deploying contracts, as these operations are irreversible on the blockchain.
- When using the onramp functionality, ensure you're on a secure connection.
- Verify all transaction details before confirming, especially when transferring funds or buying credits.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that your Coinbase API credentials are correct
2. Verify that your seed phrase is valid
3. Ensure you're on the correct network (Base Mainnet)
4. Check the Claude Desktop logs for any error messages
