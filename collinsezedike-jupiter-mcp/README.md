# Jupiter MCP ‚Äì Token Swap MCP via Jupiter API

Jupiter MCP is a TypeScript/Node.js MCP server that facilitates instant token swaps and limit orders seamlessly on Solana using [Jupiter API](https://dev.jup.ag/docs/). It provides utilities for managing Solana token metadata, token balance checks, token lists, and wallet-based operations using environment-based configuration.

This MCP abstracts the complexity of on-chain interactions by providing a structured, context-aware layer for initiating and managing token swap operations. It is designed to be easily integrated with LLM agents, bots, or apps that require secure and reliable access to decentralized liquidity.

## Features

- üîÅ **Token Swapping**: Execute swaps across the best available routes using Jupiter‚Äôs liquidity aggregator.
- üì¶ **Context-Aware Requests**: Encodes user intent and wallet info into structured commands for model-to-protocol interaction.
- üîê **Secure Transaction Handling**: Signs and sends transactions only with explicit user approval.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Wallet Initialization:** Securely initialize a Solana wallet from a private key.
- ü§ñ **LLM-Ready**: Built to support AI agents in understanding and executing financial actions through structured model context.
- üíº **Token Metadata Management:** Add and retrieve token metadata from a JSON file.
