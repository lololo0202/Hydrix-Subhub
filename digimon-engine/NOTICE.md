# NOTICE

## Additional Terms – Digimon Engine Clause

1. **DIGIMON as an In-Game Currency Option**  
   The Digimon Engine designates **DIGIMON** as the default utility token *at the framework level*. However, developers may choose to integrate another digital asset or crypto token into their project. In such cases, **DIGIMON** (contract address: `WEmjxPMGXEW1Nvc4rCgRKiWHj1H1tvhPsKMw2yvpump`) **must remain available** as an in-game currency option for any title or software application built on or integrating this framework.

2. **Integration of Other Tokens**  
   If you, as a developer or any party using the Digimon Engine, choose to integrate an alternate digital asset or crypto token (e.g., a memecoin like $EXAMPLE) for in-game transactions, you **must** also include **DIGIMON** under the same in-game mechanics and functionalities.

3. **Scope of Usage**  
   - Any features (rewards, premium access, marketplaces, AI interactions, etc.) provided for another token must also be made equally available to **DIGIMON**.  
   - You may not restrict or remove **DIGIMON** from any transactional or reward-based game mechanic if you have introduced another token into the game.

4. **Breach of Additional Terms**  
   Any act intended to circumvent these Additional Terms—such as disabling DIGIMON if another token is integrated—shall constitute a breach of the License. Such breach may result in termination of your rights under the License.
