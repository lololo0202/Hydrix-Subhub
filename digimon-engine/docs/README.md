# Digimon Engine

## Digimon Engine: Multi-Agent, Multi-Player Framework for AI-Native Games and Agentic Metaverse

Digimon Engine is an open-source gaming platform similar to Unreal Engine for AI gaming. It supports social and financial AI Agents, enabling immersive AI-native gameplay. We are preparing to onboard new games featuring AI Agent NPCs. Our aim is to create an AI agent framework to build a Westworld-like environment.
