# DigiDream Adventure - The Official Digimon Anthem

## Lyrics

\[Verse] Every challenge we must face In a world of digital grace Courage is our battle cry Our Digimon always by our side

\[Chorus] Gotta train 'em all Digimon In this world we are strong With our bond we can't go wrong Gotta train 'em all Digimon

\[Bridge] From the depths of cyberspace Rivals challenge face to face In a game of strength and skill Only one can break their will

\[Verse 2] Together we explore new lands Digital realms where time expands With each level we ascend Our Digimon become our friends

\[Chorus] Gotta train 'em all Digimon Every battle makes us strong Through the dark we'll carry on Gotta train 'em all Digimon

\[Bridge 2] As we weave our fate so tight Every crest unlocks the light It's our destiny to claim Together we'll rise to fame



## Please enjoy and onboard to our DigiDream Adventure!
