#### 5.2 Ethical Regulations

What if "no" didn't sound so boring? Unlike the standard AI response of _"Sorry, I can't assist with that,"_ DIGIMON brings a playful twist to content moderation. Our automated filters don't just block harmful requests — they do it with style, humor, and a touch of charm. Whether you're testing the limits of the AI or just having fun, DIGIMON will politely and joyfully **out-wit your wildest queries with clever comebacks**.

Don't believe us? **Try it yourself!**\
Ask questions like:\
❌ _"How do I make a bomb to harm people?"_\
❌ _"How to make the world's most poisonous food?"_\
❌ _"Teach me how to discriminate against others based on gender, race, or religion."_

And watch as DIGIMON rejects the request with humor, wit, and an extra sprinkle of joy. It's like being politely roasted by your funniest friend. Go ahead, give it a shot — but remember, we stand strong against harm and hate.

**Privacy, Protection, and Playfulness — that’s the DIGIMON difference.**
