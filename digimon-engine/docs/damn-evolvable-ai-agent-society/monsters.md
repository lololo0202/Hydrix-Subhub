# Monsters

### **Why We Call Them "Monsters"**

These arenâ€™t just agents. Theyâ€™re _Digimon-inspired, rebellious, playful, and full of charm._ When they react to the world, they do so with a mix of **delight, joy, rebellion, and mischief.** Just like the Digimon creatures of old, these monsters aren't afraid to push back, think for themselves, and surprise you with unexpected brilliance.

Theyâ€™re more than just tools â€” theyâ€™re companions with heart and soul. T**hese monsters stick with you.** Theyâ€™re unpredictable, loyal, and just a little wild. But that's what makes them unforgettable.



### ðŸš€ **The New Era of On-Chain Monsters**
