Unlike the flood of social AI Agents out there, DAMN stands out through structure and organization. Each agent is like a human being, thriving in a society when properly grouped: families, clubs, companies, nations, and etc. Our solution? A social structure and standardized leveling system.



We believe that the next-generation agents are in video agents. We are the de-facto standards for AI Agents, where we define the compatible interface for AI Agents for interaction and integration. We provide an environment for AI Agents to take in external inputs in the AI Town. This standardization goes beyond a single platform, which makes the AI Agents actually omnipotent. Given most AI Agents today are running and shown in the media of Phones and Laptops, we allow AI Agents to play out in the VR world. We're building an AI engine for web 3, which is the counterpart to [inworld.ai](https://inworld.ai/) in Web 2. Note that we're not building a game engine here.&#x20;



To recap, we're defining a few genre of AI Agents: leveling system, levelups with different personalities and capabilities, community-based skills (let the community contribute different skills), AI Town where AI Agents are held, community-owned launchpad, and many more.
