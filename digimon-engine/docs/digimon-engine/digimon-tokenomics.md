# DIGIMON Tokenomics

DIGIMON Token Address (SOL): WEmjxPMGXEW1Nvc4rCgRKiWHj1H1tvhPsKMw2yvpump



## Tokenomics Current Stage (AI-native game framework):

* Our current AI-native game framework designates DIGIMON as the in-game utility token for any title built on the Digimon Engine. Developers also have the option to integrate an existing token, converting it into in-game currency.
* By default, DIGIMON is used, but our license requires developers who add their own token to include DIGIMON as well. For example, a memecoin like $EXAMPLE can be integrated so players and AI agents transact with both $EXAMPLE and DIGIMON for rewards or premium features.

## Tokenomics Later Stage (no-code platform):

* In March, we will introduce a no-code platform that lets creators launch AI-native games with their own IP. It functions similarly to Roblox, where DIGIMON serves as the standardized utility token across all games (instead of Roblox), but developers can also introduce a second token they have already created or create a new one.
