# Digimon Studio

[Digimon Engine](https://docs.digimon.tech/digimon) is Multi-Agent, Multi-Player Framework for AI-Native Games and Agentic Metaverse. As it is open-sourced for game devs to build games, we want to enable everyone to build games regardless of the technical background and coding skills.



Our Digimon Studio, as a no-code game development platform, enables anyone to customize our westworld-like game. While Digimon Studio cannot allow that of high degree-of-freedom with respect to the game engine, this is a much higher dimension of memefied expression.



Say everyone has his/her own unique way of expression and identity. The simplest and lowest dimensional expression is text, as we all express emotion and language in instant messages, emails, or tweets. This is the simplest text-based meme, aka 1D Meme.



The form of language over time evolves into simple emojis / images, thereby coming the meme like WIF / PEPE/ BONK / BOME, which we call 2D Meme.



As the simple emojis / images start to move, act, and talk, we have 3D Memes, like

* [Virtuals](https://app.virtuals.io/) enables the creation, deployment, and monetization of AI agents across various digital ecosystems.
* [Eliza](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/) & [ai16z](http://ai16z.ai/): creating and deploying autonomous AI agents.
* [Ava & Holoworld](https://app.holoworld.com/): AI-powered character creation and storytelling platform.



While all these are lively 3D Memes as the projection of our real selves, we as the high-dimension creatures like human beings can project ourselves more effectively when the dimensionality of reduction is higher.



Thereby we have the 4D Memes, the AI Gaming sandbox, as the ultimate form of Meme as allowed by the current technology. AI Agents in Gaming are the next step towards AGI, and also the most expressive form of emotion and language for humanity.



Let's say you're a Harvard PhD student in Biology. Your everyday life revolves around your Bio research lab. You have lab work to do in the web lab with test tubes, equipments, bacteria colony, and etc. You put in the time and energy in additional to the grant and equipments / raw materials in exchange for new discovery and knowledge in the form of academic achievement. The westworld for you would be the Harvard Biology lab, and the AI Agents around you are other Biology PhD students, postdocs, and professors. Your mission in the game is to publish more papers, get tenure-track positions. Is this a simulation of your life? This is a better expresion of your emotion and liveliness compared to a static / live AI Agent that talks and interacts with the external.



Digimon Studio, the platform for 4D Memes, the ultimate form of Meme for expressing humanity.
