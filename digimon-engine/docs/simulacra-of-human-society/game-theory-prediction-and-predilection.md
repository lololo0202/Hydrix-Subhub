# Game Theory: Prediction and Predilection

"If you say why not bomb them tomorrow,

I say why not bomb them today?

If you say today at five o'clock,&#x20;

I say why not at one o'clock?"

— John Von Neumann

The successful qualities as put forward by 4 aspects of the Game Thoery:

1. Nice
2. Forgiving
3. Retaliatory (if your opponent defects, strike back immediately. Don't be a pushover)
4. Clear

We hope to see these predictions and predilections in our Simulacra of Human Society, and wish the positive outcome can align with our prediction.
