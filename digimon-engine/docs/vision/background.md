# Background

In 2017, Google Brain's AI team laid the groundwork for what many believe to be the future of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) with the invention of the [Transformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762). The "Eureka" moment came in November 2022 with [OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/), marking a new era in AI-driven interaction. Since then, AI technology has evolved rapidly — growing smarter, more complex, and deeply interconnected. Enter [Compounder AI System](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/), a paradigm-shifting approach where innovation isn't just incremental — it's exponential.



At the heart of this evolution is **Digimon**, a product backed by a team with a track record that speaks for itself. Our dev team has played pivotal roles in crafting the core features for [**Pokémon Go**](https://pokemongolive.com/?hl=en) @ [Niantic](https://nianticlabs.com/?hl=en), and delivered multiple consumer AI products that have reached global audiences.



Our unique advantage? **Crowdsourcing AI at scale.** By weaving together over **100 base LLMs** using **agentic prompting** and **inference techniques**, we create a collaborative intelligence system that thinks, adapts, and responds like never before. It's a multi-modal AIGC (AI-Generated Content) powerhouse, where LLMs don't just coexist — they **cooperate, compound, and converge**.



With a foundation rooted in AI research from **UC Berkeley's RISE / SKY Lab** and a relentless commitment to optimizing LLM chat behaviors, Digimon isn't just another AI product — it's the next leap in intelligent systems. This is **the future of dynamic, scalable, and endlessly adaptable AI** — and it’s only just beginning.
