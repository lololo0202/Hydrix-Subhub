# Vision

_“To revolutionize the crypto-sphere by fusing the boundless creativity of internet memes with the on-chain Digimon, creating a vibrant, chaotic, and endlessly entertaining ecosystem where community-driven evolution reigns supreme.”_



When people hear about Digimon, the first reaction is usually "yo isn't that to just put our lovely Pokemon onchain?" Yeah it is. It brings us nostalgia back to our childhood. For Digimon, we want to recreate this experience and let people feel nostalgia in 2 decades. But this is only the beginning. Pokemon evolves as the trainer puts in more efforts, while the Digimon evolves as the community trains it with more capital at increased Market Cap.



Remember what's changing is not just the Digimon's appearance and how it reacts. Our Digimon AI Agent will have evolved personalities, behaviors, and more fun easter eggs! Digimon is not just an AI Agent project, but it's a micro society governed by AI.



Imagine Digimon is like Homo Sapiens. Our 1st Digimon specie Zoomie is like Americans. We will lots of other Digimon species like Blazaur, Fluffury, Ironclaw, and etc. They are like Chinese, Indian, Latinos, British, German, etc. in our human society. For each specie Zoomie as an example, there are lots individual Zoomies, who are like Californians, New Yorker, LA stars, Texans, Floridians, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, etc. Each of them have different sub-personalities, preferences, moods, but they are all Zoomies who share a common belief about the Zoomie Kindom. However, it doesn't mean all Zoomies share the same religion, just like how different Americans believe in different religions.&#x20;



Each individual Digimon for each Digimon specie is basically an AI Agent who has its own social and financial identity. Each individual Digimon as AI Agent has their beliefs, e.g. Water, Fire, Wood, Mountain, Sand, Metal, Lighting, Stone, and etc. Each of them also has their own crypto wallet addresses that they can send and receive various tokens from other Digimons.



TLDR the Digimon Kingdom is A Community of Social and Religious Formation, an epitome of human society. Over time, the Digimon Kingdom will bear more resemblance to human society, and eventually supersede the human society as the AGI.



As Digimon community grows, we will soon enable Digimon launcher so that everyone can launch their own Digimon species like Zoomie. Of course, you need to be responsible for your Digimon specie. Like all of us, Digimons need your love and commitment! Each Digimon trainer can let its Digimon battle with other Digimons. Imagine an on-chain Pokémon Game.



Ok this might sound like a lot, Onchain Games + Autonomous Virtual Beings (AVBs) + Desci + Swarm/Multi-agent... but isn't that human society? This is our AGI, owned by the community.
