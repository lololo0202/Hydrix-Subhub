# Active Context: Go-Sui-MCP

## Current Focus
- Core MCP functionality implementation complete
- Sui client integration established
- Transaction handling implemented
- Server modes (stdio and SSE) working

## Recent Changes
- Implemented core Sui client operations
- Added MCP server functionality
- Implemented transaction handling
- Added configuration management
- Implemented tool registration system

## Next Steps
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Implement additional Sui operations
- Add more test coverage
- Enhance documentation
- Add monitoring and metrics

## Active Decisions
- Using Cobra for CLI implementation
- Using Viper for configuration management
- Implementing both stdio and SSE server modes
- Following Go best practices for error handling
- Using modular architecture for extensibility
