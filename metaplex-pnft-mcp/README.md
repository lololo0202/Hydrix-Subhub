# Metaplex MCP ‚Äì pNFT Creation via Metaplex

Metaplex pNFT MCP is a TypeScript/Node.js Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a structured and agent-friendly interface for the creation of programmable NFTs (pNFTs) using the [Metaplex](https://developers.metaplex.com/) protocol on Solana.

This module allows AI agents, bots, or user-facing applications to mint rich, policy-controlled NFTs by encoding user intent and asset metadata into actionable instructions. Ideal for decentralized content creators, dynamic asset generation, or automated collection management.

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è **pNFT Minting:** Create Metaplex-compliant programmable NFTs with custom rules, creators, and metadata.
- üß† **Context-Driven Creation:** Encode asset details (name, description, URI, attribute) through structured model context.
- üîê **Secure & Verifiable Transfers:** Ensures swaps are signed and verified with full user approval.
- üß© **Dynamic Use Cases:** Supports minting NFTs for identity, media, access control, or game assets.
- üíº **Secure Transaction Handling**: Signs and sends transactions securely, using environment-based key management.
