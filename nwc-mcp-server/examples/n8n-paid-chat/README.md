# N8N Paid chat

This allows you to put your whole N8N workflow behind a paywall on a friendly chat interface. You can then use any N8N native tool, or connect to any MCP server, so the possibilities are endless.

In N8N, create a new workflow and then use the import from file option ([download the raw workflow](./n8n-paid-chat.json))

To get started with N8N and NWC, [Read the N8N section in the main README](../../README.md#add-to-n8n-community-node) for how to configure N8N with NWC MCP server.

By default the agent uses OpenRouter with a free LLM (Optimus Alpha) but you can choose any LLM that supports tool calling.
