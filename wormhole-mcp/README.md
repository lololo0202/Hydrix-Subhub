# Wormhole MCP ‚Äì Multichain Token Transfer MCP via Wormhole SDK

Wormhole MCP is a TypeScript/Node.js Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables automatic transfer of tokens across multiple blockchains using the [Wormhole SDK](https://wormhole.com/). It provides utilities for managing cross-chain transfers, wallet operations, and environment-based configuration for secure key management.

This MCP abstracts the complexity of cross-chain interactions by providing a structured, context-aware layer for initiating and managing token transfers. It is designed for easy integration with LLM agents, bots, or applications that require secure and reliable access to decentralized cross-chain liquidity.

## Features

- üåê **Cross-Chain Swaps:** Move native tokens between EVM and non-EVM chains using Wormhole‚Äôs trusted bridging layer.
- ü§ñ **Agent-Friendly Protocol:** Encodes user intent and target chain data into a standardized, model-readable format.
- üîê **Secure & Verifiable Transfers:** Ensures swaps are signed and verified with full user approval.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Modular Integration:** Easily plugs into existing model or bot frameworks alongside other MCP components.
- üì° **Chain-Agnostic Design:** Built to support a growing number of chains supported by Wormhole NTT.
- üíº **Secure Transaction Handling**: Signs and sends transactions securely, using environment-based key management.
